# The Dactyl-ManuForm Keyboard
This is my fork of the [dactyl-manuform](https://github.com/abstracthat/dactyl-manuform) keyboard project.

## The case/plate
I built the case and plate using the [Dactyl Manuform Configurator](https://ryanis.cool/dactyl) from [rianadon](https://github.com/rianadon). If you want to customize your own using mine as a starting point, you can use [my config url](https://ryanis.cool/dactyl/#manuform:ChwIBhAFGgNzaXgiA3R3byoCbXgyBm5vcm1pZTgAIhdVAACAQBgAIAFdAADgQGUAAEBAQAFIAA==).
